GRAPHICS
‾‾‾‾‾‾‾‾
The ./graphics directory features graphical aspects of the user interface that exceed the capabilities of HTML with CSS, such as: 

- SVG               # All types of SVG markup can be placed in the ./graphics/svg directory. 
                    # SVG can alternatively be placed in component or player directories 
                    # depending the severity of SVG usage.

- Images            # All types of images can be placed in the ./graphics/images directory.
                    # Images should not be placed within components or players as there is no
                    # semantic or manipulative advantages in contrast with SVG markup.
                    # SVG images can be used in either ./graphics/svg or ./graphics/images 
                    # directories.
                    # All types of image code can reside in images including base64 snippets

- Fonts             # Fonts should be either:
                    # - woff2
                    # - CSS base64 woff2


The ./graphics directory should not include assets that are considered as content. 
All assets within ./graphics should only be part of the user interface not articles 
or posts.
