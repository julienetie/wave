DAEMONS
‾‾‾‾‾‾‾
The ./daemons directory contains modules that operate in the background in excess of typical UI behaviors such as:

- Operations during idle time
- Time monitoring
- Non-user driven XHR requests

A daemon is not directly user-driven but may be an indirect result of a user's action.

If there is too much ambiguity around clarifying a service as a daemon, it's probably not a daemon.
