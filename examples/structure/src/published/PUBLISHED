The ./published direcotry contains assets and content for published or frequently changing content.
This excludes imagery for standard user interfaces which resides in the ./graphics directory.

E.g. 

    - A news article's text content can be found within ./published/images/_text.json.js
    - A news article's image could be found within ./published/images 
    - A news article's video could be found within ./published/video
    - The content of an about page

The published folder does not need to be in use. Typically published content and assets are managed 
by content management systems. This folder resides for parts of projects where content is requried but may be lacking the advantage of a content management system.
