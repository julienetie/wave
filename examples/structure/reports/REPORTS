REPORTS
‾‾‾‾‾‾‾
The ./reports directory is for generated reports (automated).
E.g. unit-test coverage. Mandotory reports are: 

- _layers.yaml            # A list of all selectors with z-index values
- _public.yaml            # The public structure
- _src.yaml               # The source structure
- _stats.txt              # Development and public statistics
